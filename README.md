**Overview of Streams in Express.js**

**Introduction to Streams**
- Streams are essential for handling large data files efficiently in Node.js applications. They allow data to be processed in chunks rather than loading entire files into memory at once .

**Problem with Large Files**
- When dealing with large files, such as a 400 MB text file, loading the entire file into memory can lead to high memory consumption, which may crash the server if multiple users access the file simultaneously .

**Using Streams for Efficient Data Handling**
- Streams allow for reading data in smaller chunks, which can be sent to the user as they are read. This prevents excessive memory usage and keeps the server responsive .
- The concept of streaming is akin to how videos are played on platforms like YouTube, where data is processed and displayed in real-time .

**Implementing Streams in Express.js**
1. **Creating a Server**: Set up an Express server to handle requests for file data .
2. **Reading and Streaming Data**:
   - Use the `fs` module to create a readable stream from the file.
   - Send data chunks to the client as they are read, rather than waiting for the entire file to load .
3. **Example Code**:
   ```javascript
   const fs = require('fs');
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   app.get('/file', (req, res) => {
       const stream = fs.createReadStream('sample.txt');
       stream.on('data', (chunk) => {
           res.write(chunk);
       });
       stream.on('end', () => {
           res.end();
       });
   });

   app.listen(3000);
   ```

**Monitoring Memory Usage**
- Use packages like `express-status-monitor` to keep track of memory consumption and server performance .

**Benefits of Using Streams**
- Reduces memory consumption significantly by processing data in smaller chunks.
- Improves server performance and responsiveness, especially under high load conditions .

**Conclusion**
- Implementing streams in Express.js is a powerful way to handle large files efficiently, ensuring that applications remain performant and scalable. By streaming data, developers can provide a better user experience while managing server resources effectively.
